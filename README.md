This is a small application with the intent to inform about vendors that have 
sued security researchers. It is publicly deployed on [shouldiresponsiblydisclose.de](https://shouldiresponsiblydisclose.de/).
If you think a vendor is missing, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/derconno/shouldiresponsiblydisclose/issues)!
